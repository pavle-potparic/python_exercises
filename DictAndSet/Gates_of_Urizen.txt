"Gates Of Urizen"

As above, so below
All things come from the one
Now you are the victim
Carried by the wind, rooted in the ground

If you want to learn the secrets
Close your eyes
The ladder falls away

At the gates of Urizen

Fallen eagles blaze

At the gates of Urizen

Eternal twins are damned

At the gates of Urizen

Separate lives begin
In every woman is a man
From the moon come silver ghosts
Spectres of the blood
From my spirit comes the darkness
From the void, the crimson fortress rises

At the gates of Urizen

The ladder falls away

At the gates of Urizen

Fallen eagles blaze

At the gates of Urizen

Eternal twins are damned

At the gates of Urizen

Separate lives begin

At the gates of Urizen

The ladder falls away

At the gates of Urizen

Fallen eagles blaze

At the gates of Urizen

Eternal twins are damned

At the gates of Urizen

Separate lives begin

At the gates of Urizen

The gates of Urizen

The gates of Urizen

At the gates...
